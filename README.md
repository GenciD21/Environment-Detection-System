# Envrionmental Detection Systems

  In this project, my plan is to create an IoT device that allows the user to interface primarily with the BME280 Sensor in order to get a combination of humidity, pressure and temperature sensor. With it, we'll stream the data over the web to a host computer that well proccess the data accordingly.
